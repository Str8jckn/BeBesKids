    Hi
    Im <strong>Jerome Brown</strong>, 
     Born in Georgia, I am a <b>US Air Force <i>Brat</i></b>, 
     <em>(which usually means your parents  are military)</em> 
     as well as a <b> USAF Veteran</b>. I’m married, with 3 beautiful girls 
     ranging from age 1-14. I did 9 years active duty before getting 
     out to find a skill, i landed on becoming an electrician. It took 
     me four years to graduate and test for a <sub>Journeyman</sub> <sup>electrician</sup> license. 
     Ever since I accomplished that, I’ve been looking onto the next 
     skill to either enhance my career or completely change my career. 
     Whichever offers a higher ceiling. I took this class to become familiar 
     with <mark>programming</mark>. After completing this class I hope to focus on either 
     <ins>Machine Learning</ins>, or <ins>Cyber Security</ins> .

            <div><p id="btn"><b>Machine Learning </b></div>

                Machine learning is the concept that a computer program 
                can learn and adapt to new data without human intervention.
                 Machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence <i>(AI)</i>
                  that keeps a computer’s built-in algorithms current
                   regardless of changes in the worldwide economy <sup>?</sup> 
                    <!--which AI movie is your favorite?-->

            <p><div><p id="btn"><b>Cyber Security </b></div>

                Cyber security is the practice of defending computers,
                 servers, mobile devices, electronic systems, networks, 
                 and data from malicious <i>attacks</i>. It's also known as 
                 information technology security or electronic information 
                 security.
